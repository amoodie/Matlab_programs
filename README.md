# Matlab repository

This repository contains tools I have written that I frequently use in modeling or calculations. 

It is mostly exceptionally basic functions that either store static but helpful information (e.g., physical constants, color sets) or perform routine opertations that are simple but take up a lot of lines (i.e., cleans up the base workspace).

It also contains a few simple self contained models I have developed.
