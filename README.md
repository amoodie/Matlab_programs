# Matlab repository

This repository contains tools I have written that I frequently use in modeling or calculations. 

It is mostly exceptionally basic functions that either store static but helpful information (e.g., physical constants, color sets) or perform routine operations that are simple but take up a lot of lines of code (i.e., cleans up the workspace).

It also contains a few simple self contained models I have developed.

A summary of _some_ of the functions in here is included. See the file for more documentation.


#### categorical2jitterMat.m

__categorical2jitterMat__ reshapes data for parallel boxplot-jitterplot.

#### dist2bulk.m


#### formatRegression.m

__formatRegression__ formats a linearized multivariate regression matrix to a power law regression string.
For example, `formatRegression(beta, {'u_*/w_s', 'Re_p', '1/\alpha'})` returns the string to be formatted with `text` as

#### get_DSV.m


#### get_criticalstress.m


#### inspire.m


#### load_colorSet.m


#### load_conset.m


#### modelEvalPts.m


#### sprintsci.m

__sprintsci__ prints number in fully formatted scientific notation. 
E.g., `sprintsci(0.0483244)` returns a string `'4.832\times10^{-2}'`.
